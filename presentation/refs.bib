   abstract = "Manifold learning (ML), also known as nonlinear dimension reduction, is a set of methods to find the low-dimensional structure of data. Dimension reduction for large, high-dimensional data is not merely a way to reduce the data; the new representations and descriptors obtained by ML reveal the geometric shape of high-dimensional point clouds and allow one to visualize, denoise, and interpret them. This review presents the underlying principles of ML, its representative methods, and their statistical foundations, all from a practicing statistician&apos;s perspective. It describes the trade-offs and what theory tells us about the parameter and algorithmic choices we make in order to obtain reliable conclusions.",
